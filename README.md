# Somnia: A College Life Simulator
Repo for CSC 4790 Senior Project Somnia. Experience the wonders of time, energy, and sleep management during college life.

Full Abstract:
Somnia will be a continuation of our project from CSC4700 Software Engineering, and will function relatively the same way, alongside new additions such as minigames and a revamped night section. To reiterate, this game will emphasize the importance of sleep and time management in a college setting by putting the player in the shoes of a new college student trying to make their way in the world of education. Players will be challenged to manage their stats in order to make sure their college experience goes as smoothly as possible. Stats can be changed either by interactions during their time at school, or by making it through the night section (preferably with a good nightâ€™s rest). Stats in this game will play a major role; they will determine whether or not the player can succeed in certain actions during the day, and they will also determine the difficulty of the night section, which will simulate how well they sleep, and what their stats will be when they wake up and start a new day.

### Prerequisites
Download [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), and go to Installs on the left > Install Editor in the top-right.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open Unity Hub and go to Projects on the left.
3. Select the **Open** button in the top-right.
4. Navigate to and select the project directory `senior-project-somnia-game`.

### Contributing
1. Scripts (code) are in `Assets/Scripts`. You can edit them in your preferred editor, however Visual Studio is the most compatible with Unity and allows autocomplete.
2. Scenes (graphically editable in Scene view) are in `Assets/Scenes`. 
3. To edit dialogue, you have to have the DialogueEditor view open. Go to Window > DialogueEditor and place it where you like. Then make sure you have a NPCConversation object (i.e., an object with the NPC Conversation script attached to it) selected. For more details, check the DialogueEditor documentation in `Assets/DialogueEditor/DialogueEditorDocumentation.pdf` or [here](https://github.com/CSC4790-Fall2022-Org/senior-project-somnia-game/blob/dev/Assets/DialogueEditor/DialogueEditorDocumentation.pdf).
4. You can preview how the game looks with the Game view.
